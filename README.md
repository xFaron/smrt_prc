## Codebase Structure

* **`config/`** – Configuration files for training different models.
* **`data/`** – Stores project datasets.
  *Note: Do not upload this folder to Git.*
* **`experiments/`** – Contains local experiments and test runs.
  Push only results and model weights from successful experiments (i.e., models ready or nearly ready for production). Keep other experiment data local.
* **`notebooks/`** – Jupyter notebooks for testing and analysis.
* **`outputs/`** – Used for generated results once the full pipeline is integrated.
* **`scripts/`** – Project-related helper scripts.
* **`src/`** – Core production code.
* **`utils/`** – General-purpose utilities and helper tools.
